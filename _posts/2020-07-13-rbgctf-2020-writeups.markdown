We're given a .WAV file, and the clue tells us that it came over the radio, so right away we can go looking for ways to decode this 36 second audio clip into something meaningful.  When you open it with Audacity and look at the spectrogram,  we are presented with the image on the left.  After a little bit of digging, the image matches pretty closely with what a [Slow Scan Television (SSTV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television) signal looks like (image on the right)

Often times programs that pull data from audio involve complex setups with virtual audio devices and whatnot. Luckily there's a tool on GitHub ([xdsopl/robot36](https://github.com/xdsopl/robot36)) to encode/decode SSTV in a mode called Robot36. After compiling the tool, we run it against the file and grab our flag!
